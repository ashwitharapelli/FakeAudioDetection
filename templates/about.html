    <center><h1>ℹ️ About Fake Audio Detection</h1></center>
    <p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.7;">
        The <strong>Fake Audio Detection</strong> project is an AI-powered web application designed to identify whether an uploaded audio file is <strong>real</strong> or <strong>synthetically generated</strong> (fake).
        In an age where deepfakes and synthetic media are rapidly advancing, verifying the authenticity of audio has become crucial — especially in areas like journalism, law enforcement, and digital forensics.
    </p>

    <h2>🔍 How It Works</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.7;">
        The system uses a trained <strong>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)</strong> model to analyze the audio signal. Once a user uploads a `.wav` file, the model processes the audio features and returns a prediction indicating whether the file is real or fake, along with a confidence score.

    <h2>📦 Features</h2>
    <ul style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.7;">
        <li>🎧 Upload and test `.wav` audio files</li>
        <li>🤖 AI-based prediction using LSTM model</li>
        <li>📊 Confidence score with every prediction</li>
        <li>📱 Send result reports via SMS (Twilio integration)</li>
        <!--<li>🌐 Web-accessible interface via Flask + Ngrok</li> !-->
    </ul>

    <h2>💡 Use Cases</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.7;">
        - Detecting deepfake audio in voice recordings<br>
        - Authenticating evidence in legal investigations<br>
